<h2>The Work we do for you.</h2>
	<p>
		Our team uses Agile Methodologies when we map out and build a project with you. This approach 		promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and delivery, it encourages rapid and 		flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen interactions 		throughout the development cycle.
	</p>
<h2>The Kickoff</h2>
	<p>
		The first step is when we meet with you and other project stakeholders to scope out your 				goals and objectives. All parties buy-in, collaborate, and discuss a project feature list 		used as the basis for the initial release.
	</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
	<p>
		The key to a projectâ€™s success is a continued communication between the web developer and 			clients. A constant feedback assures that the development process can quickly adjust course 		to address challenges and exploit opportunities that may surface throughout the course of the 		project.
	</p>

<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
	<p>
		We recognize that even after the final product ships, many of our clients may require 					continuous engagement to either wean internal teams to operate on their own, or to 				provide longer term management and development support.
